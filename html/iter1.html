        This data set contains information about loans from the peer to peer lending company Prosper.
        Each borrower enters various information about themselves, including salary, which is verfied,
        as well as having a credit record pulled. Based on this data, Prosper calculates a 
        "Prosper Score", which indicates investment risk on a scale from 1-11, 11 being best, or 
        lowest risk. <br><br>
        Shown below, we see that the lowest loan APRs go to those with the lowest risk score. Interestingly, 
        salary doesn't play nearly as much a roll as the Prosper Score. Next, let's see how well Prosper Score and 
        salary can paint a picture with respect to other indicators of financial health.

        Revolving credit balance is the portion of credit card spending that goes unpaid at the end of a billing 
        cycle. Although you would typically think an unpaid credit card balance is a bad thing for loans, loan 
        companies actually don't consider it to be a bad thing on its own. Below, we can see that although 
        higher unpaid balances are much more common as salary increases, the prosper score is unaffected.

        Much more concerning to loan companies is delinquency in payment. Below, we can see that a high rate of 
        delinquency over the last 7 years is associated strongly with poorer Proper Scores. Additionally, it appears 
        that higher rates of delinquency are more likely the less you earn, particularly if you are rated with a 
        low Prosper Score, which indicates poorer financial health overall.
