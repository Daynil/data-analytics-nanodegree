    <p>Final project for
      <a class="link" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002" target="_blank">Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree</a>

    <p class="intro">
      Udacity's data analyst nanodegree program is an in-depth program built to help students become proficient
      in each piece of the data analysis workflow, including procuring and organizing data, data munging, exploratory 
      data analysis, making predictions with machine learning, and clear communication of findings. This project 
      was the last in the degree and I used many of the skills learned in previous lessons to culminate in a 
      display of the skills I've learned.
    </p><br>
    <p class="intro">
      The full dataset used can be found on
      <a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/jschnessl/prosperloans" target="_blank">kaggle</a>. The data is from the peer to 
      peer lending company <a class="link" href="https://www.prosper.com/" target="_blank">Prosper</a>, and contains a historic 
      look at over 113,000 loans, with extensive financial data like whether the loan was completed or defaulted, the 
      loan's APR, and various pieces of information regarding the borrower's credit history.
    </p><br>
    <p class="intro">
      I chose this dataset because I've always had a strong interest in finance, especially as it relates to 
      financial investment and returns. I was curious to dig in and see what type of information could be gleaned 
      from this large, open dataset.

    <h2>Project Steps</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        The first step in any data analysis project after data acquisition is wrangling and exploring the data to 
        both determine what interesting stories can be told using the data, as well as cleaning any issues with 
        the data and piecing it together in a way that makes sense for the story you do decide to tell. Next, you 
        will present the story identified interactively, such as with d3.js.
